Using Azure Machine Learning service, you can track your models as you build, train, deploy, and manage them, all at the broad scale that the cloud provides.\n\nAzure Machine Learning service fully supports open-source technologies, so you can use tens of thousands of open-source Python packages with machine learning components such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet and scikit-learn. \n\nAzure Machine Learning service helps you orchestrate machine learning workflows using an architecture depicted on the below diagram.\n\n![AML workflow](https://github.com/jakazmie/AIDays/raw/master/DataScientistTrack/02-AML-EndToEndWalkthrough/images/amlarch.png)\n\n\n1. Data preparation and model training logic are coded as Python scripts utilizing any the hundreds of supported libraries and frameworks. The scripts can be instrumented with AML API calls to help with capturing and managing records of training runs, such as performance measures, logs, serialized models, etc.\n\n2. The scripts can execute in your local environment or on a remote Compute Target. You would usually do code development and debugging in your local environment using a small development dataset and train on a full training dataset on a remote Compute Target. The primary remote targets are Azure VMs and Azure ML Compute. The training and validation data accessed by Compute Targets is stored in AML Datastores that are backed up by Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake.\n\n3. As you run training iterations - a.k.a. runs, run records are stored in Azure ML service Experiment. You can query the Experiment's content using Python APIs or browser through it using Azure Portal.\n\n4. When your model is ready for deployment you register it in Model Registry. Model Registry maintains versions of the model including the model's serialized files and metadata.\n\n5. Depending on you deployment target, AML will create an optimized docker image and store it in private Azure Container Registry. The image includes the model, the scoring file to invoke the model, and all required runtime dependencies.\n\n6. The image can be deployed to any of the supported targets including Azure Container Instance, Azure Kubernetes Services, or Azure IoT Edge. \n\n\nAll Azure ML components are managed within a top level container - Azure Machine Learning Workspace. You can create an AML Workspace in the Azure Portal, but as the code in the following cells shows, you can also create a Workspace directly from code. \n\nBefore proceeding with AML Workspace provisioning let's double check Azure ML SDK version."
