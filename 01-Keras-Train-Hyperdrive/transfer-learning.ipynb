    "# Developing Custom Image Classification Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will developed a custom image classification model to automatically classify the type of land shown in aerial images of 224-meter x 224-meter plots. Land use classification models can be used to track urbanization, deforestation, loss of wetlands, and other major environmental trends using periodically collected aerial imagery. The images used in this lab are based off of imagery from the U.S. National Land Cover Database. U.S. National Land Cover Database defines six primary classes of land use: *Developed*, *Barren*, *Forested*, *Grassland*, *Shrub*, *Cultivated*. Example images from each land use class are shown here:\n",

    "You shall employ a machine learning technique called transfer learning. Transfer learning is one of the fastest (code and run-time-wise) ways to start using deep learning. It allows for the reuse of knowledge gained while solving one problem to a different but related problem. For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize landmarks and landscapes could apply when trying to recognize aerial land plots. Transfer Learning makes it feasible to train very effective ML models on relatively small training data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the primary goal of this lab is to understand how to use Azure ML to orchestrate deep learning workflows rather then to dive into Deep Learning techniques, ask the instructor if you want to better understand the approach utilized in the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will start by pre-processing training images into a set of powerful features - sometimes referred to as bottleneck features.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create bottleneck features you will utilize a pre-trained Deep Learning network that was trained on a general computer vision domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although, the pre-trained network does not know how to classify aerial land plot images, it knows enough about representing image concepts that if we use it to pre-process aerial images, the extracted image features can be used to effectively train a relatively simple classifier on a **limited number** of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below diagram represents the architecture of our solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Transfer Learning](https://github.com/jakazmie/images-for-hands-on-labs/raw/master/TLArch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use **ResNet50** trained on **imagenet** dataset to extract features. We will occasionally refer to this component of the solution as a featurizer. The output of the featurizer is a vector of 2048 floating point numbers, each representing a feature extracted from an image. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will then use extracted features to train a simple fully connected neural network (the top) that will peform final image classification.\n",
